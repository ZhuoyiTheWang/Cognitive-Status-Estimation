# Cognitive Status Estimation via Machine Learning

## Overview
This project contains several Python scripts designed to process, analyze, and manipulate data collected in cognitive status experiemnts. After data pre-processing, machine learning models are implemented to make predictions on cognitive statuses. Below is a description of the composition of the project. Each sub-directory also contains a readme that describes the files in more detail.

### **1. `lstm_predictor.py`**
- **Description**: The packaged class which is ready to use by the users.

---

### **2. `data`**
- **Description**: Contains the data and preprocessing scripts used to train the machine learning model.

---

### **3. `helper_functions`**
- **Description**: Contains scripts used to run the ablation study in the experiment.

---

### **4. `model_scripts`**
- **Description**: Contains scripts used to construct the models (LSTM, FNN, HMM).

---

### **5. `trained_models`**
- **Description**: Contains all the pre-trained models and performance evaluation associated with each model.

---

### **6. `visualization_and_benchmark`**
- **Description**: Contains all the visualizations(confusion matrix, network architecture...etc) for the experiment and scripts to generate those visualizations.
