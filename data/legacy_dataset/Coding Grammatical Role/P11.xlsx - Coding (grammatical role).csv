175,So look for that piece.,,,,,input manually

177,Okay. That's right. But I'll just double check. Okay. We're finished with this one.,,,,,input manually

192,It's going to be on top of the blue rectangle. Yeah. Like that.,,,,,input manually
193,And then there's going to be a yellow slope like this.,,,,,input manually
194,It's going to be stacked vertically and the slant is going to be going this way. The long face is going to be parallel. It's going to be to the left of everything.,,,,,input manually
195,"But the long side is going to be parallel to the, like the blue rectangle, and the slope is going to be pointing away. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
196,Okay. And then there's going to be a red arch inside of that. So look for a red arch.,,,,,input manually
197,23:08,,,,,input manually
198,Okay. And that's going to be stacked vertically inside the blue thing.,,,,,input manually
199,It's going to be facing the same way as the yellow arch. Yeah.,,,,,input manually
200,Okay. And then there's going to be a yellow and a green cube inside of there.,,,,,input manually
201,So look for a yellow and a green cube.,,,,,input manually
202,Okay. So the yellow cube is going to be right next to the arch on top of the blue rectangle.,,,,,input manually
203,Yeah. Right at the very right of the blue.,,,,,input manually
204,And on top of that is the green.,,,,,input manually
205,23:47,,,,,input manually
206,And then there's going to be two green semi-circles and two blue semi-circles.,,,,,input manually
207,So they're going to form like a circle on top of the arches.,,,,,input manually
208,So the green one is going to form a circle on top of the red.,,,,,input manually
209,And the blue is going to form a circle on top of that.,,,,,input manually
210,"Then, what's going to be like a circle this way.",,,,,input manually
211,It's going to be like the same shape as the cylinder from top down.,,,,,input manually
212,Yeah. So it's going to be like that except the...,,,,,input manually
213,"Both of the pieces that are going to be curved so that the indent between them is facing like perpendicular from everything else. Like this way. Yeah. So I don't know how to explain it about that, but it's going to be like that.",,,,,input manually
214,"So you need to find another green semicircle, another blue center to finish that.",,,,,input manually
215,24:58:00,,,,,input manually
216,Yeah. It's just going to finish those out.,,,,,input manually
217,25:08:00,,,,,input manually
218,"Okay. And then... Oh, no. Okay. So the semicircle is actually supposed to be on top of the green block, just to move it up there. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
219,And then a blue cube like this is on top of the yellow arch.,,,,,input manually
220,"Okay. And then there's going to be two yellow cylinders, like the blue one. So find those pieces.",,,,,input manually
221,25:49:00,,,,,input manually
222,"And then those are going to stack on top of each other on top of the blue block, the blue cube.",,,,,input manually

224,26:25:00,,,,,input manually
225,"Ok. So the first one is going to be the blue one, which is going to go on top of the cylinder.",,,,,input manually
226,It's going to be facing the opposite way.,,,,,input manually
227,"It's this yellow one. Yeah, just like that.",,,,,input manually
228,"And then there's going to be a yellow slop facing the same direction as this, on top the yellow or the blue semi-circles.",,,,,input manually
229,Yup. And then the red slope is going to be facing with the long side down.,,,,,input manually
230,"And it's going to, its slope is going to be in the same direction as the yellows.",,,,,input manually
