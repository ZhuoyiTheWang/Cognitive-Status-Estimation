127,"So, look for that piece.",,,,,input manually
128,Okay. And then two more pieces.,,,,,input manually
129,"One of them is a red triangle piece, but it's... it has the same shape as the cube.",,,,,input manually
130,It's red and triangle.,,,,,input manually
131,So look for that piece.,,,,,input manually
132,19:38,,,,,input manually
133,"Red triangle, it's going to be like, if you cut the square in half diagonally, it's going to be that shape.",,,,,input manually
134,"Oh, that's right.",,,,,input manually
135,"Okay. And then that's going to stack with the diagonal side, going towards the right of the whole thing, like this way. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
136,"And on the very top of it, is going to be a blue cylinder like this.",,,,,input manually
137,So look for that piece.,,,,,input manually
138,And then that goes on top of the two red rectangles.,,,,,input manually
139,Okay. That's right. But I'll just double check. Okay. We're finished with this one.,,,,,input manually
140,20:57,,,,,input manually
141,"Okay. So this one, I would start with the long rectangle blue piece",,,,,input manually
142,And you'll find a long rectangle blue piece.,,,,,input manually
143,"Actually, no, find two of them.",,,,,input manually
144,Cause you need one of them for the most part.,,,,,input manually
145,21:19,,,,,input manually
146,"Okay. So, you know, one of them is going to be flat like this and the next piece, it was later.",,,,,input manually
147,So next to that is going to be a yellow arch like that piece.,,,,,input manually
148,And this time you're going to have it on the short edge vertically.,,,,,input manually
149,"And the long face is going to be to the right of this, to the right of the yellow piece on the floor. The opposite. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
150,The arch is facing away from that.,,,,,input manually

152,22:01,,,,,input manually
153,Can you... you can put the next blue piece staffed vertically at the very left of this blue rectangle.,,,,,input manually
154,It's going to be on top of the blue rectangle. Yeah. Like that.,,,,,input manually
155,And then there's going to be a yellow slope like this.,,,,,input manually
156,It's going to be stacked vertically and the slant is going to be going this way. The long face is going to be parallel. It's going to be to the left of everything.,,,,,input manually
157,"But the long side is going to be parallel to the, like the blue rectangle, and the slope is going to be pointing away. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
158,Okay. And then there's going to be a red arch inside of that. So look for a red arch.,,,,,input manually
159,23:08,,,,,input manually
160,Okay. And that's going to be stacked vertically inside the blue thing.,,,,,input manually
161,It's going to be facing the same way as the yellow arch. Yeah.,,,,,input manually
162,Okay. And then there's going to be a yellow and a green cube inside of there.,,,,,input manually
163,So look for a yellow and a green cube.,,,,,input manually
164,Okay. So the yellow cube is going to be right next to the arch on top of the blue rectangle.,,,,,input manually
165,Yeah. Right at the very right of the blue.,,,,,input manually
166,And on top of that is the green.,,,,,input manually
167,23:47,,,,,input manually
168,And then there's going to be two green semi-circles and two blue semi-circles.,,,,,input manually
169,So they're going to form like a circle on top of the arches.,,,,,input manually
170,So the green one is going to form a circle on top of the red.,,,,,input manually
171,And the blue is going to form a circle on top of that.,,,,,input manually
172,"Then, what's going to be like a circle this way.",,,,,input manually
173,It's going to be like the same shape as the cylinder from top down.,,,,,input manually
174,Yeah. So it's going to be like that except the...,,,,,input manually
175,"Both of the pieces that are going to be curved so that the indent between them is facing like perpendicular from everything else. Like this way. Yeah. So I don't know how to explain it about that, but it's going to be like that.",,,,,input manually
176,"So you need to find another green semicircle, another blue center to finish that.",,,,,input manually
177,24:58:00,,,,,input manually
178,Yeah. It's just going to finish those out.,,,,,input manually
179,25:08:00,,,,,input manually
180,"Okay. And then... Oh, no. Okay. So the semicircle is actually supposed to be on top of the green block, just to move it up there. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
181,And then a blue cube like this is on top of the yellow arch.,,,,,input manually
182,"Okay. And then there's going to be two yellow cylinders, like the blue one. So find those pieces.",,,,,input manually
183,25:49:00,,,,,input manually
184,"And then those are going to stack on top of each other on top of the blue block, the blue cube.",,,,,input manually
185,"Okay. And then there's going to be a blue, a red and a yellow slope like this. So look for those pieces.",,,,,input manually
186,26:25:00,,,,,input manually
187,"Ok. So the first one is going to be the blue one, which is going to go on top of the cylinder.",,,,,input manually
188,It's going to be facing the opposite way.,,,,,input manually
189,"It's this yellow one. Yeah, just like that.",,,,,input manually
190,"And then there's going to be a yellow slop facing the same direction as this, on top the yellow or the blue semi-circles.",,,,,input manually
191,Yup. And then the red slope is going to be facing with the long side down.,,,,,input manually
192,"And it's going to, its slope is going to be in the same direction as the yellows.",,,,,input manually
193,Yeah. I think that's it. We're done with this one.,,,,,input manually
