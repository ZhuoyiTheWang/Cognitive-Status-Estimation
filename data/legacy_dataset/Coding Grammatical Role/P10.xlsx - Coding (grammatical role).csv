160,Okay. And then two more pieces.,,,,,input manually
161,"One of them is a red triangle piece, but it's... it has the same shape as the cube.",,,,,input manually
162,It's red and triangle.,,,,,input manually
163,So look for that piece.,,,,,input manually
164,19:38,,,,,input manually
165,"Red triangle, it's going to be like, if you cut the square in half diagonally, it's going to be that shape.",,,,,input manually
166,"Oh, that's right.",,,,,input manually
167,"Okay. And then that's going to stack with the diagonal side, going towards the right of the whole thing, like this way. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
168,"And on the very top of it, is going to be a blue cylinder like this.",,,,,input manually
169,So look for that piece.,,,,,input manually
170,And then that goes on top of the two red rectangles.,,,,,input manually
171,Okay. That's right. But I'll just double check. Okay. We're finished with this one.,,,,,input manually
172,20:57,,,,,input manually
173,"Okay. So this one, I would start with the long rectangle blue piece",,,,,input manually
174,And you'll find a long rectangle blue piece.,,,,,input manually
175,"Actually, no, find two of them.",,,,,input manually
176,Cause you need one of them for the most part.,,,,,input manually
177,21:19,,,,,input manually
178,"Okay. So, you know, one of them is going to be flat like this and the next piece, it was later.",,,,,input manually
179,So next to that is going to be a yellow arch like that piece.,,,,,input manually
180,And this time you're going to have it on the short edge vertically.,,,,,input manually
181,"And the long face is going to be to the right of this, to the right of the yellow piece on the floor. The opposite. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
182,The arch is facing away from that.,,,,,input manually
183,"And then to the right of that is a blue cylinder like this piece. And, yeah, just like that.",,,,,input manually
184,22:01,,,,,input manually
185,Can you... you can put the next blue piece staffed vertically at the very left of this blue rectangle.,,,,,input manually
186,It's going to be on top of the blue rectangle. Yeah. Like that.,,,,,input manually
187,And then there's going to be a yellow slope like this.,,,,,input manually
188,It's going to be stacked vertically and the slant is going to be going this way. The long face is going to be parallel. It's going to be to the left of everything.,,,,,input manually
189,"But the long side is going to be parallel to the, like the blue rectangle, and the slope is going to be pointing away. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
190,Okay. And then there's going to be a red arch inside of that. So look for a red arch.,,,,,input manually
191,23:08,,,,,input manually
192,Okay. And that's going to be stacked vertically inside the blue thing.,,,,,input manually
193,It's going to be facing the same way as the yellow arch. Yeah.,,,,,input manually
194,Okay. And then there's going to be a yellow and a green cube inside of there.,,,,,input manually
195,So look for a yellow and a green cube.,,,,,input manually
196,Okay. So the yellow cube is going to be right next to the arch on top of the blue rectangle.,,,,,input manually
197,Yeah. Right at the very right of the blue.,,,,,input manually
198,And on top of that is the green.,,,,,input manually
199,23:47,,,,,input manually
200,And then there's going to be two green semi-circles and two blue semi-circles.,,,,,input manually
201,So they're going to form like a circle on top of the arches.,,,,,input manually
202,So the green one is going to form a circle on top of the red.,,,,,input manually
203,And the blue is going to form a circle on top of that.,,,,,input manually
204,"Then, what's going to be like a circle this way.",,,,,input manually
205,It's going to be like the same shape as the cylinder from top down.,,,,,input manually
206,Yeah. So it's going to be like that except the...,,,,,input manually
207,"Both of the pieces that are going to be curved so that the indent between them is facing like perpendicular from everything else. Like this way. Yeah. So I don't know how to explain it about that, but it's going to be like that.",,,,,input manually
208,"So you need to find another green semicircle, another blue center to finish that.",,,,,input manually
209,24:58:00,,,,,input manually
210,Yeah. It's just going to finish those out.,,,,,input manually
211,25:08:00,,,,,input manually
212,"Okay. And then... Oh, no. Okay. So the semicircle is actually supposed to be on top of the green block, just to move it up there. Yeah.",,,,,input manually
213,And then a blue cube like this is on top of the yellow arch.,,,,,input manually
214,"Okay. And then there's going to be two yellow cylinders, like the blue one. So find those pieces.",,,,,input manually
215,25:49:00,,,,,input manually
216,"And then those are going to stack on top of each other on top of the blue block, the blue cube.",,,,,input manually
217,"Okay. And then there's going to be a blue, a red and a yellow slope like this. So look for those pieces.",,,,,input manually
218,26:25:00,,,,,input manually
219,"Ok. So the first one is going to be the blue one, which is going to go on top of the cylinder.",,,,,input manually
220,It's going to be facing the opposite way.,,,,,input manually
221,"It's this yellow one. Yeah, just like that.",,,,,input manually
222,"And then there's going to be a yellow slop facing the same direction as this, on top the yellow or the blue semi-circles.",,,,,input manually
223,Yup. And then the red slope is going to be facing with the long side down.,,,,,input manually
224,"And it's going to, its slope is going to be in the same direction as the yellows.",,,,,input manually
225,Yeah. I think that's it. We're done with this one.,,,,,input manually
